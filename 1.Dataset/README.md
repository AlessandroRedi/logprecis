# Dataset ðŸ’¾

This folder contains the datasets we use for the LogPrÃ©cis project. More info in the subfolders.

## Training

Here we report the datasets for:

- the **self-supervised** (i.e., Masked Language Modelling) training to perform the domain-adaptation of the original LM toward Unix;
- the **supervised task** of Named-Entity Recognition to obtain the attackers' intents from the coarse sessions

## Inference

Here we report the dataset to use at inference time once that the LM has been trained for the supervised task.
