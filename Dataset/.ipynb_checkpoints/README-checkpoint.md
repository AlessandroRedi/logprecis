# Dataset

This folder contains the datasets we use for the LogPr√©cis project.

## Training

Here we report the datasets for i) the self-supervised (i.e., Masked Language Modelling) task to perform the domain-adaptation of the original LM toward Unix; ii) the supervised task of Named-Entity Recognition (i.e., unveiling attackers' tactics within a session)

## Inference

Here we report the dataset to use at inference time once that the LM has been trained.
